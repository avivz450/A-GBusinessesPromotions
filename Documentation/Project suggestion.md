# Final Project

##### General Idea :
Web application that will market all kinds of businesses who want to get more exposure.

We will have different level of managers:
1. Super user (us) - we will have all permissions
2. Site managers - they will build a web platform on our site, and they will host the businesses owners sites, they will have some premissions.
3. Business owners - will build their web in the sites of the site manager (level 2), and they will be able to change it accordingly.


#####  Extra Emphasis :
1. Every site manager build his own site in domain to his choice.
2. Business owner will not be added automatically, the site manager need to approve him first, after he saw that the site contact are accutally relevant.
3. Once business owner noticed that his site are suitable for another site also, he wiil be able to reach the other site manager to be connected to his site also. no need to fill information aain like in the registration.
4. If the business site are promoted  in 2 or more sites, a change in one place will affects all site that promoting this business.

#####  Technologies :
Frontend : Html, CSS, JavaScript.
Backend: Django, Python.
